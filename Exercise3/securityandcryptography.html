                <br><h2>What is cryptography?</h2>
            <p>Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. Here, data is encrypted using a secret key, and then both the encoded message and secret key are sent to the recipient for decryption. Cryptography provides for secure communication in the presence of malicious third-parties—known as adversaries. Encryption uses an algorithm and a key to transform an input (i.e., plaintext) into an encrypted output (i.e., ciphertext).</p>
